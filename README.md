# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard: Plotly.js

## Overview
This page uses interactive charts to explore bacteria samples from subjects' belly buttons. The goal is to locate bacteria species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.

## Data Source
samples.json

## Results
When users go to the [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://clarerobb.github.io/biodiversity/), they see the results from the first subject (test subject ID no. 940). 

The charts display the subject's demographic information, top ten bacteria cultures found, the amount of times the subject washes their belly button per week, and the bacteria cultures per sample. 

Users can explore the full dataset by scrolling through the dropdown menu on the left and selecting a new subject number.
